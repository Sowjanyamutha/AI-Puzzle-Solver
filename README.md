This repository contains an AI-based puzzle solver written in Python. The solver uses artificial intelligence techniques to analyze and solve puzzles of varying complexity, making it a versatile tool for tackling challenging logical problems.

Features
Automated Puzzle Solving: The solver uses search algorithms to explore possible solutions and reach the target state efficiently.
Customizable Puzzle Types: Easily adaptable for different types of puzzles, including sliding puzzles, sudoku, and other constraint-based puzzles.
Optimized for Performance: Utilizes heuristics and optimization techniques to reduce computational load and solve puzzles faster.
Interactive Testing: Includes an interface for testing different puzzles and visualizing steps in the solving process.
Algorithms and Techniques
The puzzle solver leverages various AI techniques:

Search Algorithms: Depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A* search for exploring solutions.
Heuristics: Custom heuristic functions are applied for puzzles that benefit from path cost estimation.
Constraint Satisfaction: For puzzles like sudoku, the solver incorporates constraint satisfaction algorithms to efficiently prune search spaces.
